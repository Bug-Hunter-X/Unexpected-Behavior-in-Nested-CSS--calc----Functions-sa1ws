One approach to mitigate the inconsistencies in the `calc()` function is to pre-calculate the value outside of the CSS. This ensures consistency across different browsers. This may involve JavaScript calculation or server-side processing.

Another approach is to avoid nested `calc()` functions altogether, breaking the calculation into simpler steps.  For example:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}

.nested {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* ensures padding is included in total width */
  padding-left: 5px; /* half of 10px reduction */
  padding-right: 5px; /* half of 10px reduction */
}
```

This avoids the nested `calc()` and handles the 10px reduction through padding.  This method should render consistently across different browsers.
